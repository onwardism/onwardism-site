# Onwardism Is Now Part of the AWS Activate Program

We're excited to share that Onwardism has been approved for the AWS Activate program.

AWS Activate provides startups with cloud credits, technical support, and access to AWS resources—helping teams build, test, and scale reliable systems from the start. Being accepted into the program is an important milestone as we continue building open technology intelligence.

## What This Means for Onwardism

Being part of AWS Activate allows us to strengthen the foundation of the platform from day one:

- More reliable and scalable infrastructure
- Faster experimentation and iteration
- Stronger foundations for media, research, and AI workloads
- Improved security, observability, and performance

As an open-source platform, infrastructure matters. AWS Activate helps us focus more on product clarity and engineering quality, while relying on proven cloud primitives for compute, storage, and data pipelines.

## How We'll Use AWS

We'll be using AWS to support:

- Unified media workflows
- Search and indexing for technology content
- AI-assisted analysis and retrieval
- Scalable systems designed for long-term growth

This approval doesn't change our core direction. Onwardism remains open, community-driven, and engineering-first. AWS Activate simply helps us move forward with stronger technical foundations.

## Thank You

We'd like to thank AWS Activate for the support and opportunity. We're also grateful to the early community members, supporters, and readers who are following the project. Your interest, feedback, and encouragement play an important role in shaping what we build next.

We'll continue sharing progress as we build—step by step, openly.

**Make better technology decisions.**
